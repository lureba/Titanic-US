Project Objective: Titanic Survival Prediction with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Model

The objective of this project is to build a robust exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a predictive model to forecast the survival of Titanic passengers. The project combines visual storytelling with advanced technical analysis, providing a clear understanding of the factors that influenced survival and building a machine learning model to predict these chances.

In the first phase of the project, I focused on telling a story using the Titanic data. Rather than solely relying on technical charts such as scatter plots or distribution graphs, I used exploratory data analysis to provide insights into the variables that influenced survival. During this phase, I explored characteristics such as gender, social class, age, ticket fare, and embarkation port, and how these factors interacted to determine the probability of survival for passengers. The intention was to create an engaging narrative that not only explained the data but also provided an intuitive understanding of the dynamics of the Titanic, helping to visualize how different characteristics were interconnected in the tragedy.

In addition to visual analysis, the preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning phase was central to model development. To maximize prediction accuracy, I applied advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques, including BayesianSearchCV and GridSearchCV. These techniques allowed me to optimize the model parameters, ensuring that each estimator was adjusted to achieve optimal performance. I trained 10 different estimators, each with 3 distinct predictors, and applied various encoding techniques (such as One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding) and scaling techniques (such as MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler) to ensure that the data was treated appropriately for each model type.

Evaluating the performance of each predictor and estimator combination, I conducted a detailed analysis of how the models performed in terms of recall, precision, accuracy, and ROC-AUC curve. Through cross-validation, I ensured that the model was robust and generalizable, avoiding overfitting and ensuring that the results obtained were reliable across different data subsets. During the analysis, I considered situations where different models had divergent recall and precision but similar accuracies, requiring a strategic decision about which model would be more suitable depending on the context.

Finally, the decision phase involved selecting the best estimator for our goal of maximizing accuracy in survival predictions, taking into account both accuracy and the trade-offs between recall and precision. Through this careful analysis and the use of appropriate metrics, I was able to select a predictive model that balanced the need to correctly identify survivors (high recall) and minimize false positives (high precision).

The project aims not only to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques but also the ability to transform a data analysis into a comprehensible and accessible narrative, exploring the data deeply while rigorously applying modeling practices and performance evaluation.

In summary, the goal of this project is to create an efficient machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival, while also presenting an explanatory and visually appealing narrative of the factors that influenced these probabilities. This is achieved using a combination of data preprocessing techniques, predictive modeling, hyperparameter optimization, and robust model evaluation.
